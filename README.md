# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Introduction

In the realm of healthcare and medical analysis, predictive models can offer valuable insights. In this project, we aim to predict diabetes based on various health indicators. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we'll create a model that can make accurate predictions about an individual's likelihood of having diabetes.

## Problem Statement

The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for diabetes. By analyzing features such as age, gender, BMI, smoking history, and medical indicators, we aim to build a model that can accurately predict whether an individual has diabetes or not.

## Dataset

We will work with a dataset that contains information about individuals' health indicators, including age, gender, BMI, smoking history, hypertension, heart disease, and more.

## Methodology

To achieve our goal, we will follow these steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and format the dataset, handle missing values, and ensure its readiness for analysis.
2. **Feature Exploration**: Identify relevant features that could contribute to accurate predictions.
3. **Model Selection**: Explore and select suitable machine learning algorithms for classification.
4. **Model Training**: Train the selected models using the preprocessed dataset.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the models' performance using appropriate metrics.
6. **Comparison and Analysis**: Compare the different models and analyze their strengths and weaknesses.

## Project Structure

The project repository is organized as follows:

- `diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `diabeties_prediction.ipynb/`: The main script to run the project.

## Dependencies

To ensure the proper execution of the project, you'll need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
